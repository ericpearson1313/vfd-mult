Team name: Eric Pearson
Expected result (avg ns/square): 32.0 nS, ( 4 cyc @ 125 Mhz )
Design documentation (below):
- Used same numeric representation, word length, and interface as in the provided reference.
- unrolled 2 stage pipeline, with intermediate squared value register.
- Stage1: Parallel 1Kbit square unit based on 17bit DSP multiplied, with CARRY8 adder tree
- Stage2: Parallel 2Kbit product modulus with 9bit BRAM and 6bit LUTRAM reduction roms, and CARRY8 adder tree
- Stace machine controlled stage register enables and valid signals to give 2 clock cycles per stage. Multi-cycle timing constraints 
- State machine intialization delay of 4 cycles for starting value paths. Multi-cycle timing constraints
- Power savings by reset of modsqr unit upon completion of itterations.
- Power ramp up of 1ms by integrated ramp pulse modulated delay of state machine.
