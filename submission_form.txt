Team name: Eric 
Expected result (avg ns/square): 31.7 nS, ( 4 cyc @ (125*102/101) Mhz )
Design documentation (below):
- Used same numeric representation, word length, and interface as in the provided reference.
- unrolled as 2 stage pipeline, with lut address = square product register.
- Stage1: Parallel 1Kbit square unit based on 17bit DSP multiplier, with native CARRY8 adder trees
- Stage2: Parallel 2Kbit product modulus with both 8/9bit BRAMs and 5/6bit LUTRAM based word reduction roms, and native CARRY8 adder trees
- State machine controlled stage register enables and valid signals to give 2 clock cycles per stage. Multi-cycle timing constraints 
- State machine intialization delay of 4 cycles for starting value paths. Multi-cycle timing constraints
- Power savings by reset of modsqr unit upon completion of itterations, and give more cycles between before start by asserting modsq reset when IDLE.
- Power ramp up of 1ms by integrated ramp pulse modulated delay of state machine register enables.
- MMCM pll 101:102 clock multiplier along with clock domain crossing logic in the wrapper. Max-delay timing constraints.
