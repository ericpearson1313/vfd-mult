Team name: Eric 
Expected result (avg ns/square): 26.7 nS, 4 cyc @ 150 Mhz. This design must timign close as SDx auto clock adjust not available with MMCM.
Design documentation (below):
- Used same numeric representation, word length, and interface as in the provided reference.
- unrolled as single stage fully parallel operation, with the loop register being the intermediate squared product see: modular_square/model/pictures.txt
- Each stage: 2k prod_sqr_reg -> 6/6/5b LUTRAM modulus -> CARRY8 adder tree --> 1K DSP square multiply --> CARRY8 adder tree --> 2K prod_sqr_reg 
- 1 extra modsq op is required to initialize the stage.
- State machine controlled stage register enables and valid signals to give 4 clock cycles per stage. Multi-cycle timing constraints 
- Additional State machine intialization delay of 4 cycles for starting value paths. Multi-cycle timing constraints
- Power savings by reset of modsqr unit upon while IDLE or upon completion of itterations.
- Power ramp up of 1ms by integrated ramp pulse modulated delay of state machine register enables.
- MMCM pll 85:102 clock multiplier of 125 Mhz ref to give 150 Mhz. clock domain crossing logic in the wrapper. Max-delay timing constraints.
- For simulation modify POWER_RAMP to 'h100 (normally 'h1 for fpga synth). See line 57 in modular_square_8_cycles.sv
