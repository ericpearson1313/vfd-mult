Team name: Eric Pearson
Expected result (avg ns/square): 29.4 nS
Design documentation (below):
- 2 cycle design:
	- Stage1: full 1024 bit async square unit (66x17b) with adder tree
	- Stage2: Full reduction lut (Mixed BRAM and LUTRAM) and final adder tree
- Multi-cycle timing paths used:
    - 2 cycles per stage (4 cycles total) as min AWS F1 clock is 87.5 Mhz
		- enables used for registers
	- Added 4 pre-cycles to enable 6 cycles of propagation for sq_in_d1 and start_d1 signals
- AWS F1 power limits:
    - reset modsqr once the desired number of squares completed, to reduce power when not operating.
	- 1ms ramp to full power, as AWS has a max rate of increase even if under max power
		- gated 4 cycle state machine advance based on reaching integrated power level.
	- used maximum number of BRAMs to reduce logic.
- Place & Route:
    - replaced CSA trees with Adder trees.
	- used a sqare multiplier uses ~50% of the multipliers
	- used placement directive: tba
