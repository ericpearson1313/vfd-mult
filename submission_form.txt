Team name: Eric 
Expected result (avg ns/square): 27.9 nS, 4 cyc @ 143 Mhz. This design must timign close as auto clock adjust not available with MMCM.
Design documentation (below):
- Used same numeric representation, word length, and interface as in the provided reference.
- unrolled as single stage pipeline, with the loop register being the intermediate squared product see: modular_square/model/pictures.txt
- Stage1-part1: Parallel 1Kbit square unit based on 17bit DSP multiplier, with native CARRY8 adder trees
- Stage1-part2: Parallel 2Kbit product modulus using 5/6/6bit LUTRAM based word reduction roms, and native CARRY8 adder trees
- State machine controlled stage register enables and valid signals to give 4 clock cycles per stage. Multi-cycle timing constraints 
- State machine intialization delay of 4 cycles for starting value paths. Multi-cycle timing constraints
- Power savings by reset of modsqr unit upon while IDLE or upon completion of itterations.
- Power ramp up of 1ms by integrated ramp pulse modulated delay of state machine register enables.
- MMCM pll 89:102 clock multiplier of 125 Mhz ref to give 143 Mhz. clock domain crossing logic in the wrapper. Max-delay timing constraints.
- For simulation modify POWER_RAMP to 'h100 (normally 'h1 for synth). See line 57 in modular_square_8_cycles.sv
